Setting Up A Development Environment
------------------------------------

After checking out the git repo you will need to open a command line terminal 
and go to the directory: `<project_root>/js`

From there you will need to checkout the Google Closure Library (requires 
[Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/)) with the following command:

`svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ closure`

Afterwards you should have the goog directory at: `<project_root>/js/closure/closure/goog`
